# Hotel-Website
Welcome to the Hotel and Resorts Website.

This site is served using XAMPP Server. Install XAMPP for using website so that you can access the database part of the website.

Start the Apache Server and MySQL Server from XAMPP Control Panel.
As soon as your server starts you can dive into any browser of your choice and type "localhost/hotel/" and the site gets hosted.
But that's not it. First you will have to make database for the site to get values stored.
For database, go to browser new tab and type "localhost/myphpadmin/" and the back-end part i.e. SQL part is visible.
Create a new database named "hotel_db" and simply import the file attached in the repository named "hotel_db.sql".
