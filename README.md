# Hotel-Website
Welcome to the Hotel and Resorts Website.

This is a hotel website project that allows users to view hotel details, make reservations, and manage bookings. The project is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs on the XAMPP server, which provides the necessary tools for local development and testing.

## Requirements
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
* XAMPP server (or other software for running PHP and MySQL)
* Text editor (Atom, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, etc.)
 
## Usage
* Start the Apache Server and MySQL Server from XAMPP Control Panel.
* As soon as your server starts you can dive into any browser of your choice and type "localhost/hotel/" and the site gets hosted.
* But that's not it. First you will have to make database for the site to get values stored.
* For database, go to browser new tab and type "localhost/myphpadmin/" and the back-end part i.e. SQL part appears.
* Create a new database named "hotel_db" and simply import the file attached in the repository named "hotel_db.sql".
* Now just re-run the site once again and you are done!!!
